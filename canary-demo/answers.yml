observations:
  unexpected_behaviors:
    - Helm upgrade failed initially due to missing canary value in ServiceMonitor template
    - Prometheus rate() query returned no data because metrics were not scraped by default

  suggested_improvements:
    - Add a default/conditional check for .Values.canary.enabled to avoid Helm errors
    - Include or enable a ServiceMonitor by default so Prometheus can scrape metrics
